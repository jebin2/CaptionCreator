I see you have two network interfaces on your VM:

enp0s3 with IP <> (NAT adapter)
enp0s8 - This appears to be active but no IP address is shown

To access your VM via SSH from the host, you'll need to:

First, set up a Host-only or Bridge adapter in VirtualBox:

Shut down the VM
Go to VM Settings -> Network
For Adapter 2 (enp0s8), select "Host-only Adapter" or "Bridged Adapter"
Start the VM


Configure the second interface (enp0s8):
bashCopysudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
Add:
Copyauto enp0s8
iface enp0s8 inet static
    address 192.168.56.10
    netmask 255.255.255.0

Apply the network changes:
bashCopysudo systemctl restart networking
# or
sudo ifdown enp0s8 && sudo ifup enp0s8

Verify the IP was assigned:
bashCopyip addr show enp0s8

Then from your host machine, you can connect:
bashCopyssh vboxuser@192.168.56.10


Would you like me to help you set up any of these steps?
Note: The ifconfig command isn't found because it's not installed by default on newer Debian systems. You can install it with:
bashCopysudo apt install net-tools

# ssh login
    # ssh-keygen -t rsa
    # ssh-copy-id username@remote_host_ip_or_domain
    # ssh username@remote_host_ip_or_domain "command_to_execute"
